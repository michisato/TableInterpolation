TableInterpolation
==================

Data interpolation program for CSV file. 
The folder includs source files of Processing and bin files.

This version is quite limited since it is my individual use. 
Current version allows only linear interpolation (lerp) of COLUMN.
So input row size and output row size should be same (ex: when start row is 2 and end row is 10,  the data num of interpolation should be 9.). 
In addition, each row is presumed as circular data. So the first column data is automatically added into after last column in calc process. plz improve someone:)
